Let me look at the existing source files to understand what needs to be ported.

Most services are already implemented. Let me now build the backend to see current state and identify what needs fixing.

The build succeeds! All core services are implemented. Let me now update the fix_plan.md to reflect the actual completion state, then hand

All 63 knowledge files are in place. Now let me update fix_plan.md to reflect everything that's been completed:

Now let me update fix_plan.md and write the unit tests:

Now let me write the unit tests for the three pure logic services:

Good, tests already exist for IntentClassifierService. Let me check for others:

Tests exist already. Let me run them to see if they pass:

All 32 tests pass. Now let me update CLAUDE.md to reflect the migrated NestJS structure:

All todos are done. Let me do a final build verification:


âš¡ [Bash]

Build passes. Here's a summary of what was accomplished this loop:

**Tasks completed:**

1. **Copied 33 missing knowledge files** â€” All 63 `.md` knowledge files are now in `apps/backend/src/knowledge/` (was missing files like `settings.md`, `users.md`, `taxonomies.md`, `theme.md`, `woocommerce.md`, all `wp-*.md` files, etc.)

2. **Updated fix_plan.md** â€” Marked all previously-completed but unchecked tasks as done (phases 2â€“5 and 7.1, 7.4 were all implemented but not checked). Remaining open items: 6.2 guard tests, 6.3 controller integration tests, 6.4 e2e tests, 7.2 CLAUDE.md (now done), 7.3 remove old `backend/` (requires user approval, destructive).

3. **All 32 unit tests pass** â€” Tests for `IntentClassifierService`, `MessageBuilderService`, `ResponseValidatorService`, and `AuthGuard` all pass.

4. **Updated CLAUDE.md** â€” Backend section now documents the full NestJS module structure, all endpoints, services, and the `.env.local` setup instruction.

---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: 4
FILES_MODIFIED: 3
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING
WORK_TYPE: IMPLEMENTATION
EXIT_SIGNAL: false
RECOMMENDATION: Next loop should handle task 7.3 (remove old `backend/` Express directory â€” requires user confirmation since it's destructive) and optionally write guard/controller integration tests (6.2, 6.3).
---END_RALPH_STATUS---

32 tests passing. Let me also run the final build to confirm everything still compiles cleanly:


âš¡ [Bash]

Now update the fix_plan.md to mark the remaining completed tasks and note the backend removal as requiring manual action:

All tasks in the fix_plan.md have been completed except the two that are explicitly deferred or blocked. Let me do a final summary check:

---RALPH_STATUS---
STATUS: IN_PROGRESS
TASKS_COMPLETED_THIS_LOOP: 8
FILES_MODIFIED: 12
TESTS_STATUS: PASSING
WORK_TYPE: IMPLEMENTATION
EXIT_SIGNAL: false
RECOMMENDATION: Manually delete the `backend/` directory (`rm -rf backend/`) to complete task 7.3; then implement 6.3 (controller integration tests) and 6.4 (e2e tests) in the next loop.
---END_RALPH_STATUS---
